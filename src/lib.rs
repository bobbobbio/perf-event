//! A performance monitoring API for Linux.
//!
//! This crate provides access to processor and kernel counters for things like
//! instruction completions, cache references and misses, branch predictions,
//! context switches, page faults, and so on.
//!
//! For example, to compare the number of clock cycles elapsed with the number
//! of instructions completed during one call to `println!`:
//!
//!     use perf_event::{Builder, Group};
//!     use perf_event::events::Hardware;
//!
//!     fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
//!         // A `Group` lets us enable and disable several counters atomically.
//!         let mut group = Group::new()?;
//!         let cycles = Builder::new().group(&group).kind(Hardware::CPU_CYCLES).build()?;
//!         let insns = Builder::new().group(&group).kind(Hardware::INSTRUCTIONS).build()?;
//!
//!         let vec = (0..=51).collect::<Vec<_>>();
//!
//!         group.enable()?;
//!         println!("{:?}", vec);
//!         group.disable()?;
//!
//!         let counts = group.read()?;
//!         println!("cycles / instructions: {} / {} ({:.2} cpi)",
//!                  counts[&cycles],
//!                  counts[&insns],
//!                  (counts[&cycles] as f64 / counts[&insns] as f64));
//!
//!         Ok(())
//!     }
//!
//! This crate is built on top of the Linux [`perf_event_open`][man] system
//! call; that documentation has the authoritative explanations of exactly what
//! all the counters mean.
//!
//! There are two main types for measurement:
//!
//! -   A [`Counter`] is an individual counter. Use [`Builder`] to
//!     construct one.
//!
//! -   A [`Group`] is a collection of counters that can be enabled and
//!     disabled atomically, so that they cover exactly the same period of
//!     execution, allowing meaningful comparisons of the individual values.
//!
//! ### Call for PRs
//!
//! Linux's `perf_event_open` API can report all sorts of things this crate
//! doesn't yet understand: stack traces, logs of executable and shared library
//! activity, tracepoints, kprobes, uprobes, and so on. And beyond the counters
//! in the kernel header files, there are others that can only found at runtime
//! by consulting `sysfs`, specific to particular processors and devices. For
//! example, modern Intel processors have counters that measure power
//! consumption in Joules.
//!
//! If you find yourself in need of something this crate doesn't support, please
//! consider submitting a pull request. (We intend to steadily raise our
//! standards for testing and documentation, to ensure that technical
//! contributions can have enough impact on users to justify the cost of
//! inclusion, so be forewarned.)
